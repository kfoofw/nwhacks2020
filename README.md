# NW HACKS 2020: Youths Engaging Seniors (YES)

## Motivations
One of the biggest socio-economic challenges that the world is encountering and least talked about is the aging population and how the divide between the older and younger generation could potentially disrupt societies (issues like Brexit, 'OK Boomer', [increase in elderly crime rate in South Korea](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/south-korea-elderly-crime-wave-ageing-society/), etc.). Unlike in the past, with improved healthcare, the populations in most developed countries enjoy longer life expectancy with healthier lifestyles. As a consequence, the older population have a lot of value to offer to the younger generation. [According to a survey conducted in Feb 2017 in the US](https://www.nextavenue.org/old-young-better/), 77% of the adults are willing to engage with the younger generation in building meaningful intergenerational relationships.

Our team wanted to create impact for social good, and we chose to take up this meaningful project.
  
## Purpose of this App
This is an app to connect youth and seniors to build meaningful intergenerational relationships to foster an engaged community. The users can express their preferences and match appropriately with their counterparts. They can use the in-house messaging service and plan meet-ups.
